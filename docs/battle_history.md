# Battle History

## Overview

Battle History helps you review your past runs in a table so you can compare results over time using the exact values saved from your imported Battle Reports, with optional preset labels to help group runs by your own intent.

## When to Use This

- You finished a run and want to record it in the app.
- You want to find runs from a specific tier, goal, or cause of death.
- You want to label runs with a preset so you can filter and compare them later.
- You want to compare resource outcomes across runs (coins, cash, cells, reroll shards).
- You want to sort your runs to identify your highest or lowest values.

## How to Use

1. Select **Battle History** in the navigation.
2. Select **Add Battle Report** to expand the import panel.
3. Paste your Battle Report text into the import field.
4. (Optional) Enter a preset label to group runs by your own intent.
5. Select **Import Battle Report**.
6. Select values in **Filters** to narrow the table.
7. Select a column header to sort the table by that column.
8. To change a run’s preset later, select a value in the **Preset** selector inside that row.
9. To filter by a preset, select a value in **Preset** under **Filters**, or select a preset badge in the table.

## How to Read the Results

- **Battle date** and **Tier** come from the report header and help you locate runs in time.
- **Highest wave** shows the highest wave reached in that run.
- **Killed by** shows the cause of death when it exists in the report.
- **Coins earned**, **Cash earned**, and **Interest earned** match the values shown in the report summary.
- **Gem blocks**, **Cells earned**, and **Reroll shards** show run resources that may be missing in older or incomplete reports.
- **Preset** is an optional label you can use to group runs for review. It does not change any gameplay results.
- Selecting a column header toggles between ascending and descending order for that column.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Cells display an em dash (—) when the value does not exist in the imported report.

> **Caution**
> Sorting can only use values that were present when the report was imported. The app does not invent missing labels.

> **Note**
> If you delete a preset later, runs that used it can still show the saved label in the table so your history stays readable.

> **Note**
> The **Add Battle Report** panel is collapsed by default to keep the page focused on your table.
