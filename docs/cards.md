# Cards

## Overview

Cards help you track your card slot progression and keep an organized view of your card inventory with optional preset tags.

## When to Use This

- You want to confirm how many card slots you have unlocked.
- You want to record how many copies of a card you currently have.
- You want to group cards into named presets for quick filtering.
- You want a fast table view of all cards and their current values.

## How to Use

1. Select **Cards** in the navigation.
2. View **Card slots** to review your unlocked slot count.
3. Select **Unlock Next Slot** to increase your unlocked slot count.
4. View the **Cards table** to review all cards.
5. Select a card’s **Inventory** value to enter your current count.
6. Select one or more **Presets** to tag that card.
7. Select **Preset filter** to show only cards tagged with specific presets.

## How to Read the Results

- **Slots unlocked** shows your current slot count, and the maximum when it is available.
- **Level** is derived from the inventory count shown for that card.
- **Parameters** show the stored card effect text used for quick reference.
- **Presets** are labels that help you filter and group cards; they do not change gameplay outcomes.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Slot costs are shown only when the app has card slot data available.

> **Caution**
> The Cards page is an organizer and tracker. It does not recommend builds or presets.

## Advanced Usage

1. Select multiple items in **Preset filter** to narrow the table to a combined view.
2. Review the **Preset tags** list to confirm which labels exist.
