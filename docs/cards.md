# Cards

## Overview

Cards help you track your card slot progression and keep an organized view of your card inventory with optional preset tags.

## When to Use This

- You want to confirm how many card slots you have unlocked.
- You want to record how many copies of a card you currently have.
- You want to group cards into named presets for quick filtering.
- You want a fast table view of all cards and their current values.

## How to Use

1. Select **Cards** in the navigation.
2. View **Card slots** to review your unlocked slot count.
3. Review **Next slot cost** when it is shown.
4. Select **Unlock Next Slot** to increase your unlocked slot count.
5. View the **Cards table** to review all cards.
6. Select a card’s **Inventory** value to enter your current progress.
7. Review the **Inventory** display to confirm the shown threshold for that card level.
8. Select a card’s **Presets** section to add or remove preset tags.
9. Select **Preset filter** to show only cards tagged with specific presets.
10. Select **Reset Filters** to return to the full list.

## How to Read the Results

- **Slots unlocked** shows your current slot count, and the maximum when it is available.
- **Next slot cost** shows the cost for the next slot when the app has that data available.
- **Level** increases automatically when your inventory progress rolls over into the next tier.
- **Parameters** show the card description text for quick reference.
- **Inventory** is shown as current / threshold. When you exceed a threshold, the remainder carries into the next tier.
- **(MAX)** indicates the card is fully maxed and can no longer be increased.
- **Presets** are labels that help you filter and group cards; they do not change gameplay outcomes.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Slot costs are shown only when the app has card slot data available.

> **Note**
> Some slot costs may be shown as a plain number, depending on how the source data is formatted.

> **Caution**
> If the maximum slot count is not available, the app will not allow unlocking slots until that data is available.

> **Note**
> Unlocking a slot records the unlock in the app. It does not currently verify your in-game gem balance.

> **Note**
> Preset tags are shown as colored badges for readability. Colors are assigned automatically and remain consistent.

> **Caution**
> The Cards page is an organizer and tracker. It does not recommend builds or presets.

## Advanced Usage

1. Select multiple items in **Preset filter** to narrow the table to a combined view.
2. Review the **Preset tags** list to confirm which labels exist.
