# Cards

## Overview

Cards help you track your card slot progression and keep an organized view of your card inventory with optional preset tags. Card names and descriptions are based on the [Cards](https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Cards) page on the The Tower Idle Tower Defense Fandom Wiki (external).

## When to Use This

- You want to confirm how many card slots you have unlocked.
- You want to record how many copies of a card you currently have.
- You want to group cards into named presets for quick filtering.
- You want to compare cards by level, rarity, progress, or maxed status.
- You want a fast table view of all cards and their current values.

## How to Read the Results

- **Slots unlocked** shows your current slot count, and the maximum when it is available.
- **Next slot cost** shows the cost for the next slot when the app has that data available.
- **Next Level** increases automatically when your inventory progress rolls over into the next tier.
- **Rarity** shows the card’s rarity for quick scanning.
- **Progress** is shown as current / threshold. When you exceed a threshold, the remainder carries into the next tier.
- **(MAX)** indicates the card is fully maxed and can no longer be increased.
- **Parameters** show the card description with the current level value emphasized when the card is owned.
- **Presets** are labels that help you filter and group cards (unlocked via Lab Research 'Card Presets'). The Game currently allows for 6 presets to be set, this app allows as many as you'd like. Define and set Presets from the Cards Dashboard.
- **Total Cards Progress** summarizes overall collection progress across all cards:
  - **Cards Remaining** shows how many card copies are left until every card is fully maxed.
  - **Total Cards** shows the total copies required to fully max every card.
  - **Maxed Cards** shows how many cards are fully maxed.
  - **Gems Needed** is an estimate based on buying card packs.
  - **Events** is an estimate of how many event missions it would take to earn the shown gems.

    > **Note**
    > Presets can also be assigned to Battle Reports to track card usage over time. 

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Slot costs are shown only when the app has card slot data available.

> **Note**
> Some slot costs may be shown as a plain number, depending on how the source data is formatted.

> **Caution**
> If the maximum slot count is not available, the app will not allow unlocking slots until that data is available.

> **Note**
> Unlocking a slot records the unlock in the app. It does not currently verify your in-game gem balance.

> **Note**
> Preset tags are shown as colored badges for readability. Colors are assigned automatically and remain consistent.

> **Caution**
> The Cards page is an organizer and tracker. It does not recommend builds or presets.

> **Note**
> When a card is unowned (level 0), placeholder descriptions may be shown without a computed value.

> **Note**
> If the app does not have a per-level value available for a card, the Parameters text may be shown without a highlighted current value.

> **Note**
> **Gems Needed** and **Events** are estimates based on buying 10 cards for 200 gems and a “buy 80 cards” event mission. These values are helpers, not game state.

## Advanced Usage

1. Select multiple items in **Preset filter** to narrow the table to a combined view.
2. Review the **Preset tags** list to confirm which labels exist.
