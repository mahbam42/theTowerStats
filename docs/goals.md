## Notes & Limitations

> ⚠️ Note
> Completed goals are hidden by default. Use Show completed to view them.

> ⚠️ Note
> If a current level is not recorded yet, the dashboard uses an assumed baseline and calculates remaining cost from the start of the level table.

> ⚠️ Note
> Costs are informational and are based on the current level tables available in the app. Values may change when the underlying tables change.
