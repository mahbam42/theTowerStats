## Overview

The Goals Dashboard lets you set target upgrade levels and see the total currency needed to reach each target.

## When to Use This

- You want to plan upgrades by setting a clear target level.
- You want to compare multiple upgrade targets in one place.
- You want to understand how much currency is still required before you spend.

## How to Use

1. Select Goals from the navigation menu.
2. Select a Category to focus on a specific upgrade group.
3. Enter a Target level for a row.
4. (Optional) Enter a Label or Notes to remember why you set the target.
5. Select Save to store the goal.
6. Use Set max to set the target to the highest available level.
7. Use Clear to remove a saved goal.
8. Select Show completed to include goals that you have already reached.

## How to Read the Results

- Current shows your current recorded level for that parameter.
- Target shows the level you want to reach.
- Remaining shows the total currency required to upgrade from your current state to the target.
- Per-level breakdown shows each upgrade step cost so you can review the total.

## Notes & Limitations

> ⚠️ Note
> Completed goals are hidden by default. Use Show completed to view them.

> ⚠️ Note
> If a current level is not recorded yet, the dashboard uses an assumed baseline and calculates remaining cost from the start of the level table.

> ⚠️ Note
> Costs are informational and are based on the current level tables available in the app. Values may change when the underlying tables change.
