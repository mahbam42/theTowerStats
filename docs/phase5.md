# Phase 5 Summary

## Overview

This page summarizes the main features available in the app at this stage and helps you choose which view to use for the question you want to answer.

## When to Use This

- You are new to the app and want to know where to start.
- You want to decide whether to use Battle History or Charts for a review.
- You want to understand which pages support filtering and comparisons.
- You want a quick checklist of what the app can show from imported runs.

## How to Use

1. Select **Battle History** to review individual runs and confirm what was imported.
2. Select **Charts** to view trends and breakdowns across runs.
3. Select **Cards**, **Ultimate Weapons**, **Guardian Chips**, or **Bots** to review your saved progress and upgrade tables.
4. Select filters such as **Start date**, **End date**, **Tier**, and **Preset** to narrow the scope of what you see.
5. Review the page content and repeat with a different view when you want a different perspective (table vs chart vs progress).

## How to Read the Results

- Battle History shows one run per row, which is useful for spotting outliers and verifying totals.
- Charts summarize values across many runs, which is useful for trends and comparisons.
- Progress pages show base values, effective values, and costs so you can review how your saved upgrades relate to what the app displays.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> The app can only display information that you have imported or entered. If you have no runs in the selected date range, charts cannot display values for that period.

> **Caution**
> Some charts require additional selections (for example, a specific ultimate weapon or guardian chip) before they can display values.

> **Note**
> This stage focuses on recording and presenting your data. It does not provide recommendations, strategy guidance, or balance conclusions.
