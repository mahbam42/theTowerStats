# Ultimate Weapons

## Overview

The Ultimate Weapons page helps you track which Ultimate Weapons you have unlocked, how far each upgrade parameter has progressed, and how often each weapon appears in your imported Battle Reports.

## When to Use This

- You want to confirm which Ultimate Weapons are unlocked in your tracker.
- You want to record upgrade progress for a weapon’s three parameters.
- You want to compare total Stones invested across different Ultimate Weapons.
- You want to review whether a weapon appears in your imported runs.
- You want to view a descriptive sync graph for Golden Tower, Black Hole, and Death Wave based on your saved cooldown and duration values.
- You want to include Golden Bot timing in the same sync graph when you track Golden Bot cooldown and duration.

## How to Use

1. Select **Ultimate Weapons** in the navigation.
2. Select **Show** to filter to **Unlocked only** or **Locked only**.
3. Review a weapon’s **Status** to confirm whether it is unlocked.
4. Select **Unlock** on a locked weapon to mark it as unlocked in the app.
5. Select **Details** on an unlocked weapon to view its three upgrade parameters.
6. Select **Level Up** on a parameter to increase its level by 1.
7. Review **Total Stones invested** to compare overall investment between weapons.
8. (Optional) View the **Sync graph** to see when Golden Tower, Black Hole, and Death Wave are active at the same time.

## How to Read the Results

- **Total Stones invested** is the sum of the upgrade costs for the levels you have increased in the app.
- **Runs used** counts how many of your imported Battle Reports include that Ultimate Weapon.
- **Level** is your saved upgrade level for that parameter.
- **Current** is the current raw value for your saved level.
- **Next** shows the next-level value, with the change emphasized in parentheses when it can be parsed.
- **Cost** shows the next-level upgrade cost (informational only).
- **MAX** indicates the parameter has reached the highest known level and cannot be increased further in the app.
- In the **Sync graph**, an **Active (0/1)** line indicates whether each Ultimate Weapon is active at a given time.
- **All overlap** is 1 when all listed lines are active at the same time.
- **Cumulative overlap (%)** shows the running percent of time where all overlap within the displayed horizon.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Upgrades currently assume sufficient Stones. Costs are informational only, and the app does not check affordability.

> **Note**
> Locked weapons do not display parameter rows until they are unlocked in the app.

> **Caution**
> If no Battle Reports have been imported yet, **Runs used** will show “No battles recorded yet”.

> **Caution**
> **Runs used (observed)** is based on what appears in your imported Battle Reports. Some game effects (such as Perks) can temporarily enable an Ultimate Weapon for a single run, so this count may include runs where the weapon is not permanently unlocked.

> **Caution**
> If an Ultimate Weapon’s upgrade parameters are incomplete or not recognized, it may not appear on this page until the underlying data is available.

> **Note**
> The Sync graph is descriptive. It uses your saved cooldown and duration values and does not include run-by-run timing or recommendations. When Golden Bot timing is available, the graph includes Golden Bot and updates overlap accordingly.

## Advanced Usage

1. Select **Unlocked only** to review only the weapons you actively track.
2. Select **Locked only** to focus on the remaining weapons not yet unlocked in the app.
