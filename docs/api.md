# Public APIs

> **Note**
> theTowerStats does not expose a public API in Phase 5. This page reserves a stable URL for future, documented endpoints.

## Current surface

- Dashboards and management commands are the only supported interfaces.
- Any future API will be read-only and documented here with mkdocstrings-backed references.

## Planned documentation shape

- Endpoint overviews with required parameters and responses
- Usage notes with example requests
- Versioning and stability guarantees
