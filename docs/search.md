# Search

## Overview

Search helps you navigate the app quickly by finding pages and your saved labels (presets and snapshots) from a single input.

## When to Use This

- You want to jump to a dashboard without using the full navigation.
- You want to apply a saved preset to Charts quickly.
- You want to reopen a saved snapshot without browsing menus.
- You want to look up documentation using the same query.

## How to Use

1. Select the search field in the top navigation.
2. Type a short query.
3. Use the arrow keys to move through results.
4. Press Enter to open the selected result.
5. Select a result with the mouse to open it.
6. Select the documentation result to search the docs site with the same query.

## How to Read the Results

- Page results open sections of the app such as Battle History or Charts.
- Preset results open Charts with that preset applied.
- Snapshot results open the dashboard associated with the snapshot.
- Documentation results open the docs site search for the same text.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Search results reflect the account currently signed in. Presets and snapshots from other accounts do not appear.

> **Note**
> Documentation search opens the published docs site. Availability depends on the docs site being reachable from your device.

## Advanced Usage

1. Type a short, distinctive keyword from a preset or snapshot name.
2. Use the arrow keys to select the intended result.
3. Press Enter to open it without leaving the keyboard.
