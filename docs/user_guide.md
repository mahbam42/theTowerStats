# Player User Guide

## Overview

theTowerStats turns your imported Battle Reports into Battle History tables, Charts, and collection dashboards so you can review what happened in past runs and track the progress you want to save.

## When to Use This

- You want to keep a searchable history of your runs.
- You want charts that reflect only the runs you imported.
- You want to record progress for Cards, Ultimate Weapons, Guardian Chips, or Bots.
- You want to compare two runs or two time windows without changing your saved data.

## How to Use

1. Sign in to the app with your account.
2. Select **Battle History**.
3. Select **Add Battle Report**.
4. Paste the Battle Report text from the game.
5. (Optional) Enter a preset label to group runs by your own goals.
6. Select **Import Battle Report**.
7. Select **Charts** to view time-series charts based on your imported runs.
8. Select **Cards**, **Ultimate Weapons**, **Guardians**, or **Bots** to record and review saved progress.
9. Select **Sign out** to end your session.

## How to Read the Results

- Battle History shows one row per imported run, with filters and sorting to narrow what you see.
- Preset labels are shown as badges so you can scan for the context you assigned during import.
- Charts reflect the current filters you selected (date range, tier, preset, and optional overlays).
- Coins/hour and other derived values are computed from the imported run text and displayed as numbers you can compare across runs.

## Notes & Limitations

> ⚠️ Note
> This user guide avoids strategy advice. Values shown are factual outputs based on your imports and saved progress.

> ⚠️ Note
> Your data is scoped to your signed-in account. Other users on the same instance cannot see or modify your runs or progress.

> ⚠️ Note
> If a Battle Report does not contain a label (for example, a value was not present in the text), the app does not invent it.

> ⚠️ Note
> Values shown are calculated at the time you view the page and may change if your data changes.

## Advanced Usage

1. Select **Comparison** on the Charts page.
2. Select two runs to compare, or select two date windows.
3. Review the delta values to see how the selected metric changed between the two selections.
