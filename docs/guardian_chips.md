# Guardian Chips

## Overview

The Guardian Chips page helps you track which chips are unlocked, which chips are currently active, how far each upgrade parameter has progressed, and how often each chip appears in your imported Battle Reports. Guardian Chip names and descriptions are based on the [Guardian](https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian) page on the The Tower Idle Tower Defense Fandom Wiki (external).

## When to Use This

- You want to confirm which Guardian Chips are unlocked in your tracker.
- You want to keep only two Guardian Chips active at a time.
- You want to record upgrade progress for a chip’s parameters.
- You want to compare total Bits invested across different Guardian Chips.
- You want to review whether a chip appears in your imported runs.

## How to Use

1. Select **Guardians** in the navigation.
2. Select **Show** to filter to **Unlocked only** or **Locked only**.
3. Review a chip’s **Status** to confirm whether it is unlocked.
4. (Optional) Select **Wiki** next to a chip name to open its external wiki page.
5. Select **Unlock** on a locked chip to mark it as unlocked in the app.
6. Select the **Active** toggle to activate or deactivate a chip.
7. Select **Details** on an unlocked chip to view its upgrade parameters.
8. Select **Level Up** on a parameter to increase its level by 1.
9. Select **Level Down** on a parameter to reduce its level by 1.

## How to Read the Results

- **Active** shows whether a chip is currently selected as active.
- **Total Bits invested** is the sum of the upgrade costs for the levels you have increased in the app.
- **Runs used** counts how many of your imported Battle Reports include that Guardian Chip.
- **Level** is your saved upgrade level for that parameter.
- **Current** is the current raw value for your saved level.
- **Next** shows the next-level value, with the change emphasized in parentheses when it can be parsed.
- **Cost** shows the next-level upgrade cost (informational only).
- **MAX** indicates the parameter has reached the highest known level and cannot be increased further in the app.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Upgrades currently assume sufficient Bits. Costs are informational only, and the app does not check affordability.

> **Warning**
> You can have at most two Guardian Chips active at once. When the limit is reached, inactive chips cannot be activated until you deactivate one.

> **Note**
> Locked chips cannot be activated and do not display parameter rows until they are unlocked in the app.

> **Note**
> **Level Down** is available as a safety option if you accidentally record an upgrade you did not intend.

> **Caution**
> Cooldown and duration values are based on external wiki tables and are shown in seconds. Wiki values can be inaccurate or drift over time.

> **Caution**
> If no Battle Reports have been imported yet, **Runs used** will show “No battles recorded yet”.

## Advanced Usage

1. Select **Unlocked only** to review only the chips you actively track.
2. Select **Locked only** to focus on chips you have not unlocked in the app yet.
