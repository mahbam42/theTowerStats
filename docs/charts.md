# Charts

## Overview

Charts help you review how your run results change over time using the same values stored from your imported Battle Reports.

## When to Use This

- You want to see whether a value is trending up or down across recent runs.
- You want to compare results across tiers or preset labels.
- You want to review resource outcomes (coins, cash, cells, reroll shards) without scanning a table.
- You want a daily view that smooths out run-to-run variability.

## How to Use

1. Select **Charts** in the navigation.
2. Select one or more items in **Charts** to choose what you want to display.
3. Select a **Start date** and **End date** to limit the time window.
4. Select a **Tier** to focus on a single tier.
5. Select a **Preset** to focus on runs tagged with that preset label.
6. (Optional) Select a **Moving average window** to smooth the displayed line.
7. Select **Apply** to refresh the dashboard.

## How to Read the Results

- The x-axis shows dates from your imported runs.
- The y-axis shows the value for the selected chart, using the unit shown in the chart title.
- When a chart includes multiple lines, each line label tells you what group it represents (for example, a tier or a preset label).
- If a value is missing in the underlying Battle Report, the chart may show a gap for that date.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Charts use only the data you have imported. If you have not imported runs for a date range, the chart cannot display values for that period.

> **Caution**
> Some charts require additional selections. For example, “Runs Using Selected UW” needs an Ultimate Weapon selection.

> **Note**
> Moving averages change what you see on the chart, but they do not change your stored data.

## Advanced Usage

1. Select a comparison chart (for example, “Coins Earned (Compare Tiers)”).
2. Select **Tier** or **Preset** filters only when you want to narrow the comparison set.
3. Review the legend to confirm which lines correspond to which groups.
