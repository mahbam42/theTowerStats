# Demo Data

## Overview

Demo Data lets you explore the app using a small set of sample runs, without importing your own Battle Reports.

## When to Use This

- You are new to the app and want to see what pages look like with data present.
- You want to evaluate charts and dashboards before importing your own history.
- You want to compare navigation and page layout without changing your stored data.

## How to Use

1. Sign in to your account.
2. Select **View demo data** in the top navigation.
3. View **Battle History** to see example runs.
4. View **Charts** to see how filters and chart selection affect the results.
5. Select **Exit demo** in the top navigation to return to your own data.

## How to Read the Results

- Demo Data is a fixed sample dataset and does not represent your account or your game progress.
- Values shown in Demo Data are intended for navigation and feature discovery, not for strategy guidance.
- When you exit demo mode, the app returns to showing only your own imported runs and progress.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Demo Data is read-only. Importing Battle Reports and editing progress values are disabled while demo mode is active.

> **Note**
> Demo Data can include fewer runs than a real account. Some charts or dashboards may show limited results.
