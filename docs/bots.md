# Bots

## Overview

The Bots page helps you track which bots are unlocked, how far each upgrade parameter has progressed, and how often each bot appears in your imported Battle Reports. Bot names and descriptions are based on the [Bots](https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Bots) page on the The Tower Idle Tower Defense Fandom Wiki (external).

## When to Use This

- You want to confirm which bots are unlocked in your tracker.
- You want to record upgrade progress for a bot’s parameters.
- You want to compare total Medals invested across different bots.
- You want to review whether a bot appears in your imported runs.

## How to Use

1. Select **Bots** in the navigation.
2. Select **Show** to filter to **Unlocked only** or **Locked only**.
3. Review a bot’s **Status** to confirm whether it is unlocked.
4. Select **Unlock** on a locked bot to mark it as unlocked in the app.
5. Select **Details** on an unlocked bot to view its upgrade parameters.
6. Select **Level Up** on a parameter to increase its level by 1.
7. Select **Decrease level** on a parameter to reduce its level by 1.

## How to Read the Results

- **Total Medals invested** is the sum of the upgrade costs for the levels you have increased in the app.
- **Runs used** counts how many of your imported Battle Reports include that bot.
- **Level** is your saved upgrade level for that parameter.
- **Current** is the current raw value for your saved level.
- **Next** shows the next-level value, with the change emphasized in parentheses when it can be parsed.
- **Cost** shows the next-level upgrade cost (informational only).
- **MAX** indicates the parameter has reached the highest known level and cannot be increased further in the app.

## Notes & Limitations

> **Note**
> Upgrades currently assume sufficient Medals. Costs are informational only, and the app does not check affordability.

> **Note**
> Bots do not have an active or inactive toggle. Once a bot is unlocked in the app, it is treated as active.

> **Note**
> Locked bots do not display parameter rows until they are unlocked in the app.

> **Note**
> **Decrease level** is available as a safety option if you accidentally record an upgrade you did not intend.

> **Caution**
> If no Battle Reports have been imported yet, **Runs used** will show “No battles recorded yet”.

## Advanced Usage

1. Select **Unlocked only** to review only the bots you actively track.
2. Select **Locked only** to focus on bots you have not unlocked in the app yet.
