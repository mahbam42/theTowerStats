* Stats Tracking App for The Tower Mobile Game 
** Goals/Intent
- Import data via raw text paste from The Tower either after a round or from 'Battle History'
  - Will check to dedupe imports 
  - Can delete saved runs 
- Stats are then tracked and charted over time via Analysis Engine
  - Computed Rates per Round over time
  - Deltas between Rounds
- Values are parsed from Raw Values stored in the DB and normalized/derived never destroyed
- Responsive Layout/UI
  - Battle Results form is designed for mobile
** Requirements
python
django
Chart.js
Foundation
Sass
sqlite
pytest
pytest-django
ruff
mypy

** Features
- Import Data :: Page to drop in Round Results. 
- Charts :: Overview of Progress over time
- Card Library :: log and show card collection progress. Based on the work done here, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vmIA7SMLtjAY8OooS8JC8hod0Lgvr5WsXB5vIStBJJg/edit?usp=sharing
  - Card Preset Tagging
    Tag Cards into groupings and then filter display by groupings. Each card can be a part of multiple presets
  - Widget to show Card Slots unlocked with button to unlock next slot and label to show cost
    Maximum allowed for each preset
- Wiki Scraper :: Pull Data from the Fandom Wiki via Management Command
  Manual Buttons to check for update and fetch updates.
  Cite source
  Name property links to wiki page as well
  
  - Pull tables
  - Extract rows and columns
  - Normalize text (%, seconds, multipliers)


  Targets:
  - Bots Upgrades
  - Cards
  - Guardian Chips
  - UW Upgrade Table
** Core Responsibilities
*** Rate Calculations

- Derived per run and over time:
- Coins / hour
- Coins / wave
- Damage / wave
- Waves / real minute
- Resource gains per hour (cells, shards, etc.)

These back Phase 1 charts directly.

*** Delta Calculations

Between two runs or windows:
- Absolute delta
- Percentage delta
- Rolling averages

Examples:
- Coins/hour before vs after unlocking a slot
- Damage output change after a UW unlock

No interpretation — just math.

*** Parameterized Effects

Using wiki-derived tables:
- Effective cooldown at star level
- % reduction or multiplier applied
- EV calculations (e.g. wave skip)

These are:
- Deterministic
- Re-computable across revisions
- Fully testable with golden tests

*** Aggregations by Intent (Presets)

- Presets act as labels, not logic.
- Only One Preset can be active at a time
- The engine supports:
  - “Aggregate metrics for runs where preset X was active”
  - “Compare metrics across presets”

It does not decide which preset is better.

*** Analysis Engine Invocation

- Stateless
- Accepts:
  - Query params (date range, tier, context)
  - Returns DTOs only
  - No DB writes

*** Output Shape

All outputs should conform to a small set of DTO-style objects:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
DerivedMetric(
    key="coins_per_hour",
    value=Decimal,
    unit="coins/hour",
    run_id=UUID,
    context={...}
)

MetricSeries(
    key="coins_per_hour",
    points=[(timestamp, value), ...],
    context={tier, preset, uw, guardian}
)
#+END_SRC

This maps cleanly to Chart.js datasets.

** Testing Standards
- Parser golden files (real pasted runs)
- Every parser or calculation gets at least one golden test
- Wiki scraper fixture snapshots
- Math correctness tests (especially EV)
- When completing code, start building/executing tests as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.
** Sprint Roadmap
Each phase must be demoable without admin intervention.

**** Scraping Sources and Corrective Behavior
- [X] Need a Management Command to Purge WikiData, Bot Definitions, Bot Levels, Bot Parameters, Guardian Chip Definitions, Guardian Chip levels, Guardian Chip Parameters, UW Definitions, UW Levels, UW Parameters.

  
- Each parameter can be upgraded individually, so they aren't in sync by level. Current level/level unlocked can be tracked within Parameters.
- Note parameters like Range, Duration and Cooldown are unique to each UW, Bot, or Chip

***** Bots
The scraper fetchs the wrong data/table. The 4 parameters for each bot share a cost value for the upgrades. Upgrades are purchased individually, so level isn't shared across them.

The cost is in Medals.

The labs tables are outside of the current scope.

- Thunder Bot :: Duration, Cooldown, Linger, Range. All that data is in the first table on https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Bot
- Flame Bot :: Damage Reduction, Cooldown, Damage, Range. https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Flame_Bot
- Golden Bot :: Duration, Cooldown, Bonus, Range. https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Bot
- Amplify Bot :: Duration, Cooldown, Bonus, Range. https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Amplify_Bot

***** Ultimate Weapons

- 3 Parameters each, can be upgraded individually by level.
- Cost is in Stones
- Labs and Ultimate Weapon Plus are out outside of the current scope for tracking
- Similar to Bots, all levels are in the first table for each UW page, with an anchor for #Basic_Upgrades

- Chain Lightning :: Damage, Quantity, Chance https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Chain_Lightning

- Death Wave :: Damage Multiplier, Effect Wave, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Wave#Basic_Upgrades

- Golden Tower :: Coins Multiplier, Duration, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Tower#Basic_Upgrades

- Spotlight :: Coins Bonus, Angle, Quantity (number of active spotlights) https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Spotlight#Basic_Upgrades

- Smart Missles :: Damage Multiplier, Quantity, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Smart_Missiles#Basic_Upgrades

- Chrono Field :: Duration, Slow, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Chrono_Field#Basic_Upgrades

- Inner Land Mines :: Damage %, Quantity, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Inner_Land_Mines#Basic_Upgrades

- Poison Swamp :: Damage Multiplier, Duration, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Poison_Swamp#Basic_Upgrades

- Black Hole :: Size, Duration Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Hole#Basic_Upgrades

***** Guardian Chips
- There are currently 5 chips available
- Costs are in Bits
- 3 Parameters Each
- All information is located on https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian with a unique anchor for each chip

  
- Ally :: Recovery Amount, Cooldown, Max Recovery https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Ally
- Attack :: Percentage, Cooldown, Targets
  These are tracked in Battle Reports https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Attack
- Fetch :: Cooldown, Find Chance %, Double Find Chance
  These are tracked in Battle Reports. Note there is an irrelevant table above Upgrades for this chip  https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Fetch
- Bounty :: Multiplier, Cooldown, Targets
  https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Bounty
- Summon :: Cooldown, Duration, Cash Bonus
  https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Summon

***** Cards
- All listed on https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Cards#List_of_Cards
- 'Description' Column explains target and how it's modified
- Card Slots are unlocked with Gems.

**** Milestones
- [X] CardParameters → effective values
- [X] UW / Guardian parameterized metrics
- [X] Derived metrics charts
**** Exit Criteria [100%]
Wiki Effects Infrastructure

  - scrape → version → reference → compute
- [X] Demonstrated on one entity type (pick one):
  - UW or Bot or Guardian
- [X] Wiki revision change produces different derived output

  - does not invalidate existing runs
  - produces different derived results when re-run

Testing
 - At least:
   - [X] 1 golden test for a parameterized effect
   - [X] 1 test validating revision behavior

the tone and structure I'm  aiming for: professional, concise, technically accurate but still readable for non-technical users. 

- Consistent, hierarchical headings → perfect for generating a table of contents automatically in Google Docs.
- Clear sectioning by task flow (Overview → Setup → Operation → Advanced → Appendix).
- Step-by-step procedures with short bullet or numbered lists.
- Cautions and notes highlighted distinctly (we can use blockquotes and icons)
- Simple, non-code formatting — short, direct action verbs instead of command line snippets.

Cards have 7 levels of boost and progress to the next level at 0, 3, 5, 8, 12, 20, and 32. So the 'inventory' field will be used to track progress to the next tier. If you have 4 stars for a card, inventory would reflect collected up to 12 (next threshold).

    - Clean up source of 'Unknown' Parameters. There should only be 3 for each UW
      - Exactly 3 parameters per UW
        ParameterKey registry validation
        No “Unknown” rendering path in the UI

        If a parameter can’t be resolved, fail loudly in dev and show a controlled warning in prod. This will save you pain when Chips/Bots inherit the same components.

        - Call the core UI unit something like: "UpgradeableEntityDashboard"

          That mental model will pay off when you duplicate this for:

          - Ultimate Weapons

          - Guardian Chips

          - Bots
    - Add button to unlock each UW
      - Dashboard should be sorted with unlocked UWs at the top
      - Optional filter:
        - Unlocked only
        - Locked only
      - For locked UWs:
        - Replace parameter rows with a clean locked state panel
        - Show:
          - Unlock cost
          - Short description / role (1 line)
          - “Unlock” CTA
    - Show a summary of Upgrades for each UW
      - Total Stones invested
      - Key headline stat
        - Compute the lifetime contribution of each UW based on Battle Report
        - Each UW has exactly one “headline stat”
          It must map to:
          - A known Run* model field, or
          - A derived metric you already track
        - Summary row should explicitly say:
          “No battles recorded yet”
    - Show Current Upgrade Level and Value
    - Add buttons to level up each parameter
      - Optimistic UI update + server validation

      - Button locks until response returns
        
    - Show next upgrade value and cost (Cost is in Stones)
      - Disable or visually lock the level-up button when maxed
      - Clearly label MAX
      - When showing: Current value → Next value
        Visually emphasize the delta:
        - +X%
        - −0.3s
        - +2 targets

*** DONE Phase 6 Expansion of Foundation and Context [33%]
CLOSED: [2025-12-18 Thu 14:53]
- State "DONE"       from              [2025-12-18 Thu 14:53]
What’s done has been minimal by design. Now we can expand it to feel “real”. Make foundational rates, units, and context provably correct, visibly coherent, and ready to support higher-order comparisons.

**Foundation First**

Nothing else should proceed until this is locked.

A. Canonical Rate Metrics

- Coins Earned by Source → ✅ good candidate for donut

- Guardian Chip Performance → split into:

  - Contribution metrics (damage, coins, summons)

  - Fetch metrics (gems, shards, modules)

**Refinements**

- Explicitly define:

  - Which metrics roll up into Coins Earned by Source

  - Which are excluded but cross-referenced

- Add a schema note:

  - `MetricCategory = {economy, combat, fetch, utility}`

**Exit Criteria**

Each rate metric:

- Is derived from Battle Reports only

- Appears in exactly one category

- Has a deterministic total (sum of sources = total coins)


**Units Class**

This is a value wrapper and  a validation layer

- Start as validation + formatting only

- No runtime math yet beyond normalization

Tests

- Explicit unit tests for:

  - % vs x vs time

  - Magnitude safety (K / M / B / T)

  - Mixed-unit rejection (fail fast)

**Exit Criteria**

- Any metric with ambiguous units fails validation

- No dashboard renders a value without a unit contract

**Foundations:**
Revisit the work from phase 1 and expand it
- [X] Add 2–3 more canonical rate metrics. Both of these would be best displayed as a donut chart. 
  - Coins Earned by Source:
    The following values are available in Battle Reports. We should track them and show the breakdown of Coin sources. 
    - Coins From Death Wave	119.49K
    - Cash From Golden Tower	$45.27M
    - Coins From Golden Tower	3.72M
    - Coins From Black Hole	0
    - Coins From Spotlight	41.37K
    - Coins From Orb	0
    - Coins from Coin Upgrade	7.23M
    - Coins from Coin Bonuses	9.61M
  - Guardian Chip Performance:
    Also already in Battle History. metrics should be split by unit type.

    - Damage	2.49T
    - Summoned enemies	0 quantity
    - Guardian coins stolen	0 quantity (and should be included in 'Coins Earned by Source'
    - Coins Fetched	16.62K quantity (and should be included in 'Coins Earned by Source'
    - Gems	1 this and the remaining metrics can all be combined as 'Fetch metrics'
    - Medals	1
    - Reroll Shards
    - Cannon Shards	3
    - Armor Shards	0
    - Generator Shards	3
    - Core Shards	0
    - Common Modules	0
    - Rare Modules	0

- [X] Lock down Unit Model correctness
  
  - Explicit tests for %, x, time units, magnitudes
    
- **Why this matters:**
  : Every chart, comparison, and recommendation later assumes these rates are correct and consistent.


**Context:**
Revisit and build on phase 2 work
- [ ] Preset filtering edge cases
  - No preset selected
  - Preset selected but no matching runs
- [ ] Tier + Preset + Date range combinations
    Explicit Precedence:
  1. Date Range
  2. Preset
  3. Tier
  4. Empty states must:
     - Render UI
     - Return typed but empty MetricSeries


  Golden Test
    - Your “context matrix” test is excellent. Make it mandatory.

  **Exit Criteria:**

    - Same metric + same raw data + different contexts:

      - Same schema

      - Predictable empty/non-empty behavior

      - No silent fallbacks
- [ ] Rolling windows (last N runs, last N days)
- [ ] Add:
  - One “context matrix” golden test
    - Same metric, same data
    - Different context inputs
    - Assert expected shape, not just values


**Effective Value**
- [ ] Effective Value vs Base Value
  
  For each parameter, show:
  
  - Base value (raw level value)
  - Effective value (after cards, labs, relics, etc.)

  This reinforces the mental model you’ve been building everywhere else:
  GameData → Derived Metrics → What actually happens in a run.

  just a tooltip or expandable row that says “+X% from Cards” is enough.

  Guidance:

  - Keep this read-only

  - Tooltip / expandable row only

  - No recommendations yet

  **Exit Criteria:**

    - Every parameter row can explain:

    - Base value

     - Effective value

     - At least one contributing modifier


**Efficiency Metrics**
  Examples:
  - Stones per % improvement
  - Stones per second saved
  - Relative efficiency compared to other UWs

  This is powerful, but it opens balance and interpretation questions. Best added once the core dashboards are stable.

  Keep this as a Phase 6 appendix only:

    - Spec definitions

    - Sample calculations

    - No UI beyond maybe one static comparison table

    This prevents balance arguments from stalling Phase 6.
  
**Documentation**

- [X] Add Github Action to publish Docs to Github Pages
- [ ] Phase 6 Concepts” doc:
  - Units
  - Effective vs Base
  - Context
  - Why donut charts are used


**Phase 6 Exit Criteria:**

- All displayed rates:

  - Have validated units

  - Are derived from canonical sources

- Context changes:

  - Never change metric meaning, only scope

- Effective values:

  - Are visible and explainable everywhere parameters appear

- No efficiency or recommendation logic depends on undocumented assumptions

Let user select chart style and metrics to show. The Chart Builder is not a UI feature — it’s a schema and contract feature.

Before UI polish:
- A ChartConfig DTO
  - metric key(s)
  - chart type
  - grouping (time, tier, preset)
  - smoothing / aggregation options

Validation rules:
- Which metrics are compatible
- Which comparisons make sense
- A small, explicit allowed surface
- No arbitrary math

- DTO used end to end
  Introduce a single persisted/serializable DTO (and version it), use it for snapshot storage, and have the UI submit that DTO (or a strict field set) that round-trips without lossy transforms; add tests that snapshot round-trip reproduces identical DTO.
- analysis accepts ChartConfig and returns DTOs only
  Create an analysis-layer entrypoint like analysis/chart_builder.py that takes a validated ChartConfig (or builder DTO) and returns DTOs (series + metadata + comparison datasets) without any template/render knowledge; refactor core/charting/render.py to become pure formatting; add tests that renderer doesn’t compute business logic.
- UI shows only valid combinations
  Add dynamic option filtering based on registry + current selections (hide/disable + explain), not just post-validate. Likely a small endpoint that returns allowed combinations, or richer JS rules that consult metric metadata embedded in the page. Add UI tests that invalid combinations cannot be selected.
- snapshots reusable across dashboards
  What’s missing: Snapshots can be saved/loaded in the Charts modal, but they’re not a reusable “anchor” across other dashboards/pages.
  What I need: Decide what “reusable across dashboards” means in this app (e.g., global context selector applied to Charts + Battle History + Progress pages), then implement a shared snapshot picker (base template or shared component), and update multiple views to consume it consistently. Add integration tests for at least two pages.

  **You got it. In the future charts/snapshots on the progress dashboards is exactly what this app needs**
- known patch boundaries
  Add a deterministic source of patch boundary dates (settings constant, config file, or small model if you want admin-managed), pass them into render_charts(..., patch_boundaries=...), and add tests + a user-facing note describing what the boundary marker means.
- overlap windows displayed
  Compute overlap intervals (e.g., list of [start, end] windows) and display them (table under chart and/or **visual band annotations**). Add tests for interval extraction.    
  **Just the visual band will suffice, no need for the table. We should also add Golden Bot to this chart.**
- advice consumes chart comparisons + snapshot deltas
  Define an Advice input contract that takes (a) a validated chart comparison config and/or (b) two snapshot references, then computes deltas strictly from existing metric series outputs; add trace links (“based on chart X, scopes A/B”) and tests proving it’s derived from those DTOs.
- “Insufficient data” degradation
   Implement explicit insufficiency detection (e.g., <N runs per scope, missing values, empty windows) and return a structured advice item that says “Insufficient data” + why; add tests for empty and thin scopes.  

*** DONE Phase 8 Multiple Player Support

- State "DONE"       from              [2025-12-19 Fri 15:42]
Phase 8 is the point where the app stops being “your stats tracker” and becomes a shared system.
Everything else (advice, exports, demos) hangs off that fact.

## At a high level, Phase 8 has three pillars:

1. Multi-player data isolation (core)

2. Trustable, explainable advice (behavioral layer)

3. Light sharing and demo affordances (polish & adoption)

Only #1 is truly non-negotiable. The others are value multipliers.

Execution order matters: Pillar 1 must be complete and validated before Pillars 2 or 3 begin.

## What Phase 8 Is Not

To keep it clean, Phase 8 should not try to:

- Introduce simulations or RNG modeling

- Add cloud sync or real-time features

- Solve balance questions

- Become a recommendation engine that “knows best”


## The real success criterion for Phase 8 is simple:

Thirty guild members can use this daily without seeing, affecting, or confusing each other’s data—and they trust what the app tells them.

**** DONE [#A] Pillar 1: Multiple Player Support (Foundational, Blocking)
CLOSED: [2025-12-19 Fri 14:59]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-12-19 Fri 14:59]
***** Core Principle: Everything Belongs to a Player
**Analysis Engine is always player-scoped, even if there’s only one player.**
Every player-specific model must be bound to a Player.

Recommended structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Player(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    display_name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
#+END_SRC

Then every mutable/progress model gets:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
player = models.ForeignKey(Player, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
#+END_SRC

This includes:
- player_cards
- player_relics
- player_labs
- battle_report
- run_history
- sim_results
- etc.

***** Authorization

Use groups + permissions, not custom flags.

Suggested groups
|Group |Purpose |
|---+---|
|admin | me |
|player| Default |

You can enforce almost everything via queryset filtering, not permissions alone.

***** Queryset Filtering Is the Real Security Layer

Permissions stop access.
Querysets prevent data leaks.

Pattern you’ll use everywhere

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def get_queryset(self):
    user = self.request.user
    if user.is_superuser:
        return Model.objects.all()
    return Model.objects.filter(player__user=user)
#+END_SRC

This applies to:
- Admin
- API views
- List views
- Export endpoints
- Sim endpoints

If you forget this once, players see each other’s data.

**Any view that forgets to filter by player is considered a bug, not a feature gap.**

***** Django Admin: Lock It Down Properly
ModelAdmin example
#+BEGIN_SRC python
class PlayerCardAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_queryset(self, request):
        qs = super().get_queryset(request)
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            return qs
        return qs.filter(player__user=request.user)

    def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):
        if not change:
            obj.player = request.user.player
        super().save_model(request, obj, form, change)
#+END_SRC

Also:

Remove player from editable fields for non-admins

Use readonly_fields where possible

***** API Layer (Even If You Don’t Build One Yet)

Design as if you will.

Never accept player_id from the client

Always derive it from request.user.

❌ Bad

{ "player_id": 12, "wave": 4500 }


✅ Good

player = request.user.player


This avoids spoofing and simplifies logic everywhere.

***** Shared vs Player-Scoped Models (Important Distinction)

You’ll have three categories of models:

A. Global Reference Data (NO player FK)

Cards

Relics

Labs

Enemies

Waves

Balance constants

These are read-only.

B. Player State (HAS player FK)

PlayerCard

PlayerRelic

PlayerLabProgress

Unlocks

Inventory

C. Derived / Cached Results (HAS player FK)

BattleReport

SimulationRun

AggregatedStats

You can safely delete category C anytime.

***** Data Migration & Onboarding Flow

You’ll need a clean onboarding path:

User creates account

Auto-create Player via signal

Assign default group player

Initialize baseline progress rows

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_player(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Player.objects.create(user=instance)


- [ ] Existing single-player data is migrated into a Player record named 'mahbam42'
**** DONE [#A] Precondition: Advice Language Enforcement Pass

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-12-19 Fri 14:59]
Goal:
Ensure all advice output is non-imperative, non-authoritative, and explainable.

Scan all Advice for Optimization outputs and related copy.

Replace any imperative, prescriptive, or superlative language
(“should”, “best”, “optimal”, “recommended”, etc.) with descriptive, comparative phrasing.

Do not change underlying logic, metrics, or thresholds.

If advice cannot be rewritten without becoming imperative, degrade it to
“Insufficient data to draw a conclusion.”

Validate that all advice remains scoped, explainable, and traceable to charts or snapshots.

Enforcement Rule (Canonical)

Advice outputs must never use imperative or superlative language
(e.g. “should”, “best”, “optimal”, “recommended”, “must”).

Allowed Language Patterns

- “Shows higher/lower performance…”

- “Appears more efficient under these conditions…”

- “Based on the following comparison…”

- “Data suggests…”

- “Insufficient data to conclude…”

Disallowed Patterns

- “You should…”

- “Best upgrade…”

- “Optimal path…”

- “Always / Never”

- “Clearly better” (without scope)

**** DONE [#A] Pillar 2: Advice Becomes Safe, Scoped, and Goal-Aware

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-12-19 Fri 14:59]
## Advice Becomes Goal-Aware

Introduce explicit player intent.

Example intents:

- Economy / farming

- Progression / wave push

- Hybrid

Key rule:

- Intent is declared, never inferred.

This avoids creepy ML and keeps trust.

Advice now becomes:

- “For your selected goal: Farming…”

- Same advice engine

- Different filters + weights

- Advice remains comparative and descriptive; ranked or prescriptive recommendations remain out of scope.

## Weighted Efficiency Models

Phase 7 already computes:

- Stones per %

- Seconds per cooldown

- Coins per wave deltas

Phase 8 adds:

- Weighting based on intent

- Transparent formulas

Example:

Efficiency Score =
(coin_delta * economy_weight)
+ (wave_delta * progression_weight)
- (upgrade_cost * penalty)


### Requirements:

- Weights are visible

- Editable

- Default presets provided

- No hidden math.

Specifically for our Sync Chart, but also as a point of information in the docs.

The Death Wave is a single, powerful wave that deals damage based on a "damage pool."
Damage Pool: This pool accumulates damage through multiple activations, rather than resetting with each new use, signaled by the Death Wave taking on a blue tint. The damage pool only decreases by the exact amount required to destroy enemies, factoring in any bonuses. This can deal damage through armored enemies.
Persistence: The Death Wave remains active within your tower’s range until the damage pool is depleted.

So depending on conditions Death Wave can persist for a long period. Including beyond it's cool down time, so it resets and remains active until the damage pool is depleated.

It's still not right. It's showing 14 for all unlocked UWs. But I've only had Blackhole via Perk Upgrades, on a few of the runs I've added to the app.

Each UW has a row in Battle Reports that we can use to track when a UW was active in a round.

- Black Hole :: Black Hole Damage
- Chain Lightning :: Chain Lightning Damage
- Golden Tower :: Coins From Golden Tower (Under RunUtility)
- Death Wave :: Death Wave Damage
- Spotlight :: Destroyed in Spotlight (Under RunEnemies
- Chrono Field :: There doesn't appear to be a metric for Chrono Field. So this one might alwys be 0 until the Game updates. We can note it in the docs that it doesn't work.
- Poison Swamp :: Swamp Damage
- Inner Land Mines :: Inner Land Mine Damage
- Smart Missiles :: Smart Missile Damage


If each of those metrics have a value greater than 0, that UW was active during a run.

We should also note in the docs that false positives will occur and skew these counts. Because via Lab Research, Spotlight can fire missiles and the damage is logged in the same target we're using for Smart Missiles. Inner Land Mines can be deployed with a Module (Space Displacer) that we aren't tracking.

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2025-12-21 Sun 14:27]
    A. Introduce a ****design scale****
    
    Define (and enforce):
    
    -   1 spacing unit (e.g., 4px or 8px)
    -   3 text sizes: label / body / heading
    -   2 button styles: primary / secondary
    
    Right now spacing feels “organic” rather than intentional.
    
    B. Charts need stronger contrast
    
    -   Axis labels are slightly too faint
    -   Gridlines compete with data at times
    
    Suggestions:
    
    -   Reduce gridline opacity
    -   Increase line thickness slightly
    -   Use consistent color palette across all charts (even comparisons)
    
    C. Color = meaning, not decoration
    
    You’re already data-driven—lean into that:
    
    -   One color for “coins”
    -   One for “progression”
    -   One for “comparison”
    
    Users should start recognizing metrics by color without reading labels.

**Constraints:**

- Max 4 primary nav items

- Anything else must live in:

  - “More” dropdown or

  - Contextual sub-nav

- Context controls must never disappear.

- Visualization controls may collapse.

  
A. Fix wrapping by design, not luck
    
    Your top nav is trying to do too much in one row.
    
    ****Recommended pattern:****
    
    - ****Left:**** Product name + primary sections (max 4)
    - ****Right:**** Search, Docs, Account menu
    
    Move secondary links into:
    
    - A “More” dropdown
    - Or contextual sub-nav per section
    
    Example:
    
    \`\`\`
    theTowerStats | Charts | Battle History | Cards | More ▾
    				   🔍 Docs  👤
    \`\`\`
    
B. Highlight current section strongly
    
    Right now section changes are subtle.
    
    - Use:
      - Bold text
      - Bottom border
      - Accent color
      - Make it unmissable which dashboard you’re on
    
    This matters as the app grows.

> Key Principles
> - Context defines scope, not visualization
> - Charts are the focal point
> - Advanced tools are opt-in


    -   Break the “Monolithic Controls” Problem
        
        A. Split controls into ****layers****, not one column
        
        Right now everything lives in a single vertical Filters panel, which forces users to mentally parse too much at once.
        
        ****Suggested structure (top → bottom):****
        
        1.  Context (always visible, compact)\*\*
            
            -   Date range
            -   Tier
            -   Preset
            -   Rolling window (if enabled)
            
            These define **what data** you’re looking at. They should feel global and stable.
        
        2.  Chart Definition (collapsible / modal)
            
            -   Metric(s)
            -   Chart type
            -   Group by
            -   Comparison mode
            
            This is **how data is visualized**. It should not compete visually with context.
        
        3.  Advanced / Analysis (collapsed by default)
            
            1.  Moving average window
            2.  Snapshot comparison
            3.  Goal-aware weights
            
            These are power-user tools. Hide them unless explicitly opened.
            
            > ****Key principle:****
            > If a control doesn’t change the chart **immediately**, it probably belongs behind a disclosure.
B. Replace the giant sidebar with a ****Chart Control Bar****
    
    Instead of a right-hand monolith:
    
    -   Add a ****horizontal control bar above the chart(s)****:
        -   Metric selector (pill-style multiselect)
        -   Date range
        -   Tier
        -   Preset
        -   “⚙ Advanced” button
    
    It also reduces eye travel and keeps the chart as the focal point.
    
    C. Turn Chart Builder into a ****guided flow****
    
    Chart Builder is powerful, but cognitively heavy.
    
    ****Improve by:****
    
    -   Step-based layout:
        1.  Select metric(s)
        2.  Choose visualization
        3.  Group & compare
    -   Disable steps until prerequisites are met
    -   Show a live preview thumbnail
    
    This reinforces that it’s an **intentional action**, not just “more filters.”
    
    1.  Improve Visual Hierarchy (Low Effort, High Impact)
        
        A. Use section headers with purpose
        
        Right now headers are informational but not directional.
        
        Example improvement:
        
        -   ****Filters**** → “Data Scope”
        -   ****Charts**** → “What to Measure”
        -   ****Advice**** → “Insights from Current View”
    
    Add 1-line helper text under headers where needed.
    
    B. Reduce label repetition
    
    You repeat context in multiple places:

Defined unit and integration, but none of the tests use them, so you can’t easily run “fast unit only” vs “full integration” in CI/local.

- [ ] Add callouts for Regression and Golden as an additional markers (orthogonal) for fixture-driven, checksum/snapshot-style tests.
- [ ] Start using @pytest.mark.unit for pure functions/DTO parsing
- [ ] Use @pytest.mark.integration for anything with @pytest.mark.django_db, views, commands, model interactions, wiki ingestion/rebuild, migrations.
- [ ] Add Test Taxonomy and Markings to Developer Docs, and fast vs full coverage
  - [ ] Add one canonical example per category in the dev docs:
    - 1 unit test
    - 1 integration test
    - 1 regression/golden test
- [ ] Enforce markers in CI:
  - Fail CI if a test has no marker.
  - Add a pytest.ini section documenting intent (unit ≠ fast by accident)
- [ ] Each test must have exactly one speed marker (unit | integration), and may optionally have one semantic marker (regression | golden)


Acceptance criteria
- [ ] pytest -m unit runs fast (< X seconds locally).
- [ ] CI has at least two jobs: unit and full.
- [ ] Dev docs include a short Test Taxonomy section.

Battle Reports with 3+, 5+, 8+, etc are from Tournament Rounds and should be highlighted and separate from normal round tiers. There are modified enemy stats and added scaling battle conditions that make Tournament Rounds different from the corrisponding tiers.

Tournament runs are inferred from existing fields (e.g. tier labels like 3+, 5+, 8+)

Classification is:

- computed in Python

- applied in queries, serializers, or view logic

- UI and analytics use the derived classification

Example (conceptual, not code):

- Tier ends with + → run_type = tournament

- Numeric prefix → tournament_bracket

Treat Tournament Runs as a first-class dimension, not a visual tag:

- Add run_type = normal | tournament

- Add tournament_bracket = 3+ | 5+ | 8+ | …


In UI:

- Visually separate (badge + background tint is enough)

- Default filters exclude tournaments unless explicitly enabled

In metrics:
- Ensure tournaments are excluded from baseline averages unless opted in

Scope control:

- Do not rebalance metrics in Phase 10

- Do not introduce new derived stats yet. Just classification + visibility.

- One function / property:

  - is_tournament(run)

  - tournament_bracket(run)

- Do not re-infer in templates or JS

- Do not scatter regex checks

Game Time can be accelerated and the rate can be changed during a run. Either via Lab Research (max of 5x) or via perks that increase it further to a variable factor (increased by additional researchs). The hard maximum is 6.25x (according to the Wiki). However the Wiki also notes "Game speed is not accurate. x5.0 speed behaves closer to x4.0 while 6.25 is closer to x5." So our handling of it is not strictly necessary.

There are 51 detected occurances... Apply the fix as a global function, fix where `return redirect(redirect_to)` appears. 

Direct calls to redirect(user_supplied_value) are forbidden.
All redirects must pass through safe_redirect()

For Django application, you can use the function url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme to check that a URL is safe to redirect to, as shown in the following example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.shortcuts import redirect
from django.utils.http import url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme
from django.views import View

class RedirectView(View):
    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        target = request.GET.get('target', '')
        if url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme(target, allowed_hosts=None):
            return HttpResponseRedirect(target)
        else:
            # ignore the target and redirect to the home page
            return redirect('/')
#+END_SRC

Note that url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme handles backslashes correctly, so no additional processing is required.

Battle Reports aren't being imported from the dashboard or charts quick import.

I pasted in a battle report, clicked 'import battle report', the page reloaded but the battle isn't showing in the history table. This problem arose probably yesterday because I'm not seeing some other reports I tried to load, but I definitely caught it just now.
Tried in Production and repeated the results in Dev.

Expected result: Adding a battle report succeeds and is shown in the table and accesible in charts.

The game adds visual markers to denote a Tournament round, but it's not indicated in the plain text we ingest. So we need to add a toggle to the Battle History dashboard and 'quick import' on Charts to mark a log as tournament or not.

Think in three axes:

1. What system does this describe?

2. What question does it answer?

3. Is it absolute or relative?


Charts must answer one of:
- “What did I get?”
- “Where did damage come from?”
- “What killed enemies?”

Charts that answer “How should I play?” are out of scope.

***** Rebuild Chart Classifications
- Economy (What did this run produce?)
  - Coins
  - Cash
  - Cells
  - Reroll Shards

  Examples:
  - Coins by Source
  - Coins from Ultimate Weapons
  - Cash Earned per Run
  - Cash by Source (e.g. Golden Tower, Interest)
  - Cells Earned per Run

Reroll Shards Earned per Run
- Damage (Where did damage come from?)
  - Damage by Source (absolute)
  - Damage Contribution (relative / %)

  Examples:
  - Damage by Source (stacked bar)
  - % of Total Damage by Source (donut or stacked)
  - Damage vs Enemies Destroyed (comparative)
- Enemy Destruction (“What actually killed enemies?”)
  Enemy Destruction charts must compute totals from child rows, never from Battle Report totals.
  
  - Destruction by Source
  - Enemy Type Distribution

  Exanples:
  - Enemies Destroyed by Source (donut + %)
  - Enemy Type Breakdown (Basic / Fast / Tank / Ranged / Boss)
  - Destroyed in Spotlight / Golden Bot (as sources, not enemy types)
- Efficiency

  - Time-normalized metrics

  Examples:
  - Coins per Hour
  - Waves per Hour
  - Enemies Destroyed per Hour

***** Chart Types
- Distribution
  Donut, stacked bar
  → must show % explicitly

- Contribution
  Relative share of a whole
  → requires a derived denominator

- Absolute Totals
  Bars, timelines
  → no implied comparison

- Comparative
  Two related metrics side-by-side
  → must share units or be clearly labeled

  Some work done but not complete
Instead of showing 'for [x] sec' or 'by #%' the description should reflect the current card level values

For example:
- Critical Coin "Increase critical chance by +#%" ::
  Should read "Increase critical chance by +**27**%" for level 5
- Damage "Increase tower damage by x #" ::
  Should read "Increase tower damage by **4.00** #" for level 7/maxed

Card descriptions must be rendered from structured parameter data, not static strings.

Any card description containing placeholder tokens ([x], #, %, sec) must be replaced at render-time with the effective value for the card’s current level. If card level is 0 placeholder is permitted.

The displayed value must be computed using:

- base value
- per-level scaling
- current card level
- max-level cap (if applicable)

No placeholder text may remain once the computation succeeds.

Completion criteria:

- No unresolved placeholders remain anywhere in the Cards Dashboard

- All cards render level-correct values consistently

- Failure to meet any criterion means the task is incomplete

- Prompt38Validation.yml accurately marked complete

**** TODO [#A] Create a new Goals Dashboard

Create a new dashboard and widgets for players to specify a target upgrade level and calculate the total currancy needed.

A player will select a parameter from UWs/Bots/Guardian Chips and the level they want to target.

The new dashboard will show all tracked parameters. A small widget will show the relevant metrics on the respective dashboards.

The dashboard and widgets will label the currency (stones, bits, medals)

- We don't need a status column, we do need behavior for when a goal is reached. The goal should be hidden from the table. We can add a toggle to 'show completed'
- Make targets validate against max level from Bot parameter levels / Guardian chip parameter levels / Ultimate weapon parameter levels (clamp or show a clear error).
- Store both target_level and an optional notes/label per goal (lets players group goals like “Next milestone” without affecting analysis). -I like it!
- Persist an explicit assumed_current_level flag/value when current is missing (so totals are traceable even if player data changes later).
- Add a “last recalculated” timestamp and show which cost-table revision/source is used (ties nicely to your “source wikidata” keying). -I don't think we need it, but build it out clean and compartmentalized so it's easy to remove.
- Provide quick actions: “Set target = max”, “+1 level”, “Clear goal”. -We don't need " +1 level" (that's already shown on the dashboards.
- Widget UX: show top 3 by remaining cost + “View all goals” link (make sure the link uses the safe-redirect helper if any next param is involved).
- Testing: add golden tests for totals using real rows from the parameter-level tables (catches cost table changes immediately).

“Out of Scope”:
- Cloud sync
- Real-time scraping

*** TODO [#A] Exploratory Pattern Analysis (v0.X.0)    :kMeans:enhancement:

Guiding Principles:

- K-means is not an optimization engine and not advice logic.
It’s a lens.

- Players should never feel measured against others — only contextualized by them.

- Its role is to answer:

  > “What kinds of runs exist in the data, without us naming them first?”

1. Run Archetypes (descriptive only)

  Clusters emerge like:

  - Short / high-yield

  - Long / low-risk

  - Volatile / high-variance

These are labels applied after clustering, not baked into the model.

2. Better context for advice (without commands)

Instead of:

“You should invest more in X”

You get:

“Runs similar to this one often emphasize X over Y.”

That’s a huge philosophical win for your system.

3. A future bridge to personalization

Later still, this becomes:

- “You tend to play in Cluster C”

- “This run deviated from your usual cluster”

Still observational. Still safe.

To future-proof it now, I’d lock these in:

- Clustering operates on MetricSeries snapshots only

- Never used as an input to simulations or projections

- Never produces imperative language

- Fully explainable feature vector per cluster

- Can be turned off entirely with no loss of functionality

In other words: insight, not dependency.

Responsible ways to do global exploratory analytics

1. Aggregation first, always

No raw runs, no individual trajectories.

Safe:

- Cluster centroids

- Distribution ranges

- Percentile bands

Never:

- “Players like X”

- Sample runs you can inspect

- Cluster sizes that reveal minority behaviors

2. Opt-in visibility, not opt-out

This is key.

- Players participate in aggregation by default (that’s normal analytics)

- Viewing global patterns is opt-in

- UI copy explains what isn’t shown as clearly as what is

Example:

> “These patterns summarize thousands of runs. Individual players and runs are never visible.”

3. Language rules (this is huge)

You already care about this, so lean into it.

Allowed:

- “Common patterns”

- “Observed tendencies”

- “Frequently co-occurring choices”

Banned:

- “Best”, “optimal”, “top players”

- “Most successful builds”

- “What winning players do”

This prevents status pressure from forming.

4. Self-relative framing by default

Global data should always be anchored back to the player, not shown raw.

Instead of:

> “Cluster B averages 2.3M coins/hr”

Show:

> “Your run falls near the center of a common cluster that emphasizes coin efficiency over wave depth.”

The global context exists only to explain their data.

5. Minimum population thresholds

A classic but necessary guardrail.

- No global insight is shown unless N ≥ some threshold

- Prevents early users from being “the dataset”

- Prevents deanonymization through edge cases

You can even surface this transparently:

“Global patterns unlock after enough data is available.”

If done right, global clustering becomes:

- A mirror, not a scoreboard

- Educational, not prescriptive

- Optional, not normative

That’s rare in game-adjacent tools — and a real differentiator.

If clustering ever looks like:

- leaderboard-adjacent

- ranking-adjacent

- “top cluster”

- “advanced players tend to…”

**You’ve violated your core difference.**

K-means belongs entirely inside of analysis

- It explains patterns in metrics

- It never evaluates players

- It never assigns value

- It never implies success

*** TODO [#C] Hide Deathwave on UW Sync Chart
Add an optional toggle to show/hide the Death Wave activation markers (so the schedule focuses on GT/BH overlap), while still keeping everything descriptive.
*** TODO [#C] Required Doc Type Header (Must Prepend to All Docs)
Every document authored or modified by Codex must begin with exactly one of the following headers, placed at the very top of the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
User Guide Document
<!--
DOC TYPE: User Guide
AUDIENCE: Players / Non-technical users
PURPOSE: Explain how to use the feature, not how it is built
TONE: Professional, concise, non-technical
-->

Developer / Progress Document
<!--
DOC TYPE: Developer Documentation
AUDIENCE: Contributors / Maintainers
PURPOSE: Explain internal behavior, architecture, or project status
TONE: Technical, precise, implementation-aware
-->
#+END_SRC

**Enforcement Rules**
- Exactly one Doc Type Header is allowed per document
- The header must appear before any headings or content
- The selected doc type determines:
  - Tone
  - Structure
  - Allowed level of technical detail
- If the document content conflicts with the declared Doc Type, the document is considered invalid and must be rewritten

**Default Behavior**

If Codex is unsure which header to use:

- Default to User Guide
- Exclude internal details
- Favor task-based explanations
**** Checklist
Doc Type Validation
- [ ] A Doc Type Header is present at the very top of the document
- [ ] Exactly one Doc Type Header is used
- [ ] The content matches the declared Doc Type

User Guide Documents (if applicable)
- [ ] Written for non-technical users
- [ ] No internal model, class, or file names mentioned
- [ ] No code blocks or CLI instructions
- [ ] Uses clear, action-oriented language
- [ ]  Explains how to use the feature, not how it works internally

Structure & Readability
- [ ] Uses consistent hierarchical headings (H1 → H4 only)
- [ ] Headings alone form a usable Table of Contents
- [ ] Follows task flow where applicable:
  - Overview
  - When to Use This
  - How to Use
  - How to Read the Results
  - Notes & Limitations
- [ ] Steps are short and limited to one action each

Tone & Formatting
- [ ] Professional and concise
- [ ] No slang or casual phrasing
- [ ] Notes and cautions are clearly called out using blockquotes
- [ ] Avoids unnecessary technical detail

Final Sanity Check
- [ ] A new user could follow this document without external explanation
- [ ] The document reads as instructions, not a design or implementation spec
**** Reminder Prompt
Before writing any documentation, select and prepend the appropriate Doc Type Header.
Follow the documentation standards defined in agents.md.
If writing a User Guide, prioritize clarity for non-technical users, avoid internal details, and follow the required task-based structure.
Validate the final document against the Documentation Self-Check Checklist before completing the task.

This is where simulations might enter — but cautiously.

“If Golden Tower cooldown were reduced by 1 level…”

“Projected coin gain range if X upgraded next”

Still deterministic:

Based on historical deltas

No RNG modeling

No balance speculation

  Wrong paradigm for this app
Only now do you allow:

“Top 3 upgrades for your goal”

“Best next unlock based on your data”

Guardrails:

Always link back to:

Charts

Comparisons

Assumptions

Always show:

Why

Based on how much data

What would change the recommendation

This keeps it defensible.
