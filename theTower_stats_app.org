* Stats Tracking App for The Tower Mobile Game 
** Goals/Intent
- Import data via raw text paste from The Tower either after a round or from 'Battle History'
  - Will check to dedupe imports 
  - Can delete saved runs 
- Stats are then tracked and charted over time via Analysis Engine
  - Computed Rates per Round over time
  - Deltas between Rounds
- Values are parsed from Raw Values stored in the DB and normalized/derived never destroyed
- Responsive Layout/UI
  - Battle Results form is designed for mobile
** Requirements

** Features
- Import Data :: Page to drop in Round Results. 
- Charts :: Overview of Progress over time
- Card Library :: log and show card collection progress. Based on the work done here, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vmIA7SMLtjAY8OooS8JC8hod0Lgvr5WsXB5vIStBJJg/edit?usp=sharing
  - Card Preset Tagging
    Tag Cards into groupings and then filter display by groupings. Each card can be a part of multiple presets
  - Widget to show Card Slots unlocked with button to unlock next slot and label to show cost
    Maximum allowed for each preset
- Wiki Scraper :: Pull Data from the Fandom Wiki via Management Command
  Manual Buttons to check for update and fetch updates.
  Cite source
  Name property links to wiki page as well
  
  - Pull tables

  - Normalize text (%, seconds, multipliers)


  Targets:
  - Bots Upgrades
  - Cards
  - Guardian Chips
  - UW Upgrade Table
** Core Responsibilities
*** Rate Calculations

- Derived per run and over time:
- Coins / hour
- Coins / wave
- Damage / wave
- Waves / real minute
- Resource gains per hour (cells, shards, etc.)

These back Phase 1 charts directly.

*** Delta Calculations

Between two runs or windows:
- Absolute delta
- Percentage delta
- Rolling averages

Examples:
- Coins/hour before vs after unlocking a slot
- Damage output change after a UW unlock

No interpretation — just math.

*** Parameterized Effects

Using wiki-derived tables:
- Effective cooldown at star level
- % reduction or multiplier applied
- EV calculations (e.g. wave skip)

These are:
- Deterministic
- Re-computable across revisions
- Fully testable with golden tests

*** Aggregations by Intent (Presets)

- Presets act as labels, not logic.
- Only One Preset can be active at a time
- The engine supports:
  - “Aggregate metrics for runs where preset X was active”
  - “Compare metrics across presets”

It does not decide which preset is better.

*** Analysis Engine Invocation

- Stateless
- Accepts:
  - Query params (date range, tier, context)
  - Returns DTOs only
  - No DB writes

*** Output Shape

All outputs should conform to a small set of DTO-style objects:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
DerivedMetric(
    key="coins_per_hour",
    value=Decimal,
    unit="coins/hour",
    run_id=UUID,
    context={...}
)

MetricSeries(
    key="coins_per_hour",
    points=[(timestamp, value), ...],
    context={tier, preset, uw, guardian}
)
#+END_SRC

This maps cleanly to Chart.js datasets.

** Testing Standards
- Parser golden files (real pasted runs)
- Every parser or calculation gets at least one golden test
- Wiki scraper fixture snapshots
- Math correctness tests (especially EV)
- When completing code, start building/executing tests as specific as possible to the code you changed so that you can catch issues efficiently, then make your way to broader tests as you build confidence.
** Sprint Roadmap
Each phase must be demoable without admin intervention.

**** Scraping Sources and Corrective Behavior
- [X] Need a Management Command to Purge WikiData, Bot Definitions, Bot Levels, Bot Parameters, Guardian Chip Definitions, Guardian Chip levels, Guardian Chip Parameters, UW Definitions, UW Levels, UW Parameters.

  
- Each parameter can be upgraded individually, so they aren't in sync by level. Current level/level unlocked can be tracked within Parameters.
- Note parameters like Range, Duration and Cooldown are unique to each UW, Bot, or Chip

***** Bots
The scraper fetchs the wrong data/table. The 4 parameters for each bot share a cost value for the upgrades. Upgrades are purchased individually, so level isn't shared across them.

The cost is in Medals.

The labs tables are outside of the current scope.

- Thunder Bot :: Duration, Cooldown, Linger, Range. All that data is in the first table on https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Bot
- Flame Bot :: Damage Reduction, Cooldown, Damage, Range. https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Flame_Bot
- Golden Bot :: Duration, Cooldown, Bonus, Range. https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Bot
- Amplify Bot :: Duration, Cooldown, Bonus, Range. https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Amplify_Bot

***** Ultimate Weapons

- 3 Parameters each, can be upgraded individually by level.
- Cost is in Stones
- Labs and Ultimate Weapon Plus are out outside of the current scope for tracking
- Similar to Bots, all levels are in the first table for each UW page, with an anchor for #Basic_Upgrades

- Chain Lightning :: Damage, Quantity, Chance https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Chain_Lightning

- Death Wave :: Damage Multiplier, Effect Wave, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Wave#Basic_Upgrades

- Golden Tower :: Coins Multiplier, Duration, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Tower#Basic_Upgrades

- Spotlight :: Coins Bonus, Angle, Quantity (number of active spotlights) https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Spotlight#Basic_Upgrades

- Smart Missles :: Damage Multiplier, Quantity, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Smart_Missiles#Basic_Upgrades

- Chrono Field :: Duration, Slow, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Chrono_Field#Basic_Upgrades

- Inner Land Mines :: Damage %, Quantity, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Inner_Land_Mines#Basic_Upgrades

- Poison Swamp :: Damage Multiplier, Duration, Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Poison_Swamp#Basic_Upgrades

- Black Hole :: Size, Duration Cooldown https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Hole#Basic_Upgrades

***** Guardian Chips
- There are currently 5 chips available
- Costs are in Bits
- 3 Parameters Each
- All information is located on https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian with a unique anchor for each chip

  
- Ally :: Recovery Amount, Cooldown, Max Recovery https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Ally
- Attack :: Percentage, Cooldown, Targets
  These are tracked in Battle Reports https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Attack
- Fetch :: Cooldown, Find Chance %, Double Find Chance
  These are tracked in Battle Reports. Note there is an irrelevant table above Upgrades for this chip  https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Fetch
- Bounty :: Multiplier, Cooldown, Targets
  https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Bounty
- Summon :: Cooldown, Duration, Cash Bonus
  https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Guardian#Summon

***** Cards
- All listed on https://the-tower-idle-tower-defense.fandom.com/wiki/Cards#List_of_Cards
- 'Description' Column explains target and how it's modified
- Card Slots are unlocked with Gems.

**** Milestones
- [X] CardParameters → effective values
- [X] UW / Guardian parameterized metrics
- [X] Derived metrics charts
**** Exit Criteria [100%]
Wiki Effects Infrastructure
- [X] At least one complete pipeline:
  - scrape → version → reference → compute
- [X] Demonstrated on one entity type (pick one):
  - UW or Bot or Guardian
- [X] Wiki revision change produces different derived output
- [X] Golden test proving revision safety
- [X] One derived effect chart rendered dynamically

Parameterized Effects
- [X]  At least one wiki-derived parameter table is:
  - scraped
  - versioned
  - referenced by the Analysis Engine

- [X] At least one effect calculation exists:
  - e.g. effective cooldown or EV of wave skip

Derived Metrics
- [X] Derived metrics:
  - are computed dynamically
  - are not persisted
- [X] Derived metrics appear as charts:
  - alongside raw metrics
  - with correct units

Backward Safety
- [X]  Changing wiki parameters:
  - does not invalidate existing runs
  - produces different derived results when re-run

Testing
 - At least:
   - [X] 1 golden test for a parameterized effect
   - [X] 1 test validating revision behavior
*** Phase 5 Dashboard UX [66%]
Goal:
- Turn the analysis engine outputs into clear, usable, player-facing dashboards.
- No new math. No new scraping logic. No new domain models.

Previous drafts indicated using Tailwind CSS for this project. We will now be implementing Foundation Framework.

General conventions across all Dashboards:
- Nav Header
- Global Search Box
- Links to Docs and Admin
- Apply Foundation styles consistently
- Establish shared dashboard components:
  - Filters (Tier, Date Range, Preset)
  - Empty states
  - Loading states

the tone and structure I'm  aiming for: professional, concise, technically accurate but still readable for non-technical users. 

- Consistent, hierarchical headings → perfect for generating a table of contents automatically in Google Docs.
- Clear sectioning by task flow (Overview → Setup → Operation → Advanced → Appendix).
- Step-by-step procedures with short bullet or numbered lists.
- Cautions and notes highlighted distinctly (we can use blockquotes and icons)
- Simple, non-code formatting — short, direct action verbs instead of command line snippets.

Cards have 7 levels of boost and progress to the next level at 0, 3, 5, 8, 12, 20, and 32. So the 'inventory' field will be used to track progress to the next tier. If you have 4 stars for a card, inventory would reflect collected up to 12 (next threshold).

    - Clean up source of 'Unknown' Parameters. There should only be 3 for each UW
      - Exactly 3 parameters per UW
        ParameterKey registry validation
        No “Unknown” rendering path in the UI

        If a parameter can’t be resolved, fail loudly in dev and show a controlled warning in prod. This will save you pain when Chips/Bots inherit the same components.

        - Call the core UI unit something like: "UpgradeableEntityDashboard"

          That mental model will pay off when you duplicate this for:

          - Ultimate Weapons

          - Guardian Chips

          - Bots
    - Add button to unlock each UW
      - Dashboard should be sorted with unlocked UWs at the top
      - Optional filter:
        - Unlocked only
        - Locked only
      - For locked UWs:
        - Replace parameter rows with a clean locked state panel
        - Show:
          - Unlock cost
          - Short description / role (1 line)
          - “Unlock” CTA
    - Show a summary of Upgrades for each UW
      - Total Stones invested
      - Key headline stat
        - Compute the lifetime contribution of each UW based on Battle Report
        - Each UW has exactly one “headline stat”
          It must map to:
          - A known Run* model field, or
          - A derived metric you already track
        - Summary row should explicitly say:
          “No battles recorded yet”
    - Show Current Upgrade Level and Value
    - Add buttons to level up each parameter
      - Optimistic UI update + server validation

      - Button locks until response returns
        
    - Show next upgrade value and cost (Cost is in Stones)
      - Disable or visually lock the level-up button when maxed
      - Clearly label MAX
      - When showing: Current value → Next value
        Visually emphasize the delta:
        - +X%
        - −0.3s
        - +2 targets

**** TODO Update readme.md

- Project Status reflects docs/ revisions 
**** Milestones
- [X] All dashboards share a single visual and structural language
- [X] On Battle History Player can scan, filter, and trust historical data quickly
- [X] A new contributor understands the app without a walkthrough
**** Exit Criteria [16%]
UX & Data Integrity:
- [ ] Dashboards display only computed outputs
- [ ] No dashboard performs calculations inline
- [ ] All filters affect views consistently

Coverage:
Every major entity has a visible dashboard:
- [ ] Battle History
- [ ] Charts
- [ ] Cards
- [ ] UWs
- [ ] Guardians
- [ ] Bots

Stability:
- [ ] No new models added
- [ ] No migrations required
- [ ] Test suite passes unchanged

### Demo Test
A new user can:
1. Import runs
2. View history
3. Inspect progress
4. Understand trends …without explanation.
*** Phase 6 Expansion of Foundation and Context [0%]
What’s done is minimal by design. Expand it to feel “real”:

**Foundations:**
- [ ] Add 2–3 more canonical rate metrics

- [ ] Normalize time handling everywhere (game time vs real time vs accelerated)
  
- [ ] Lock down Unit Model correctness
  
  - Explicit tests for %, x, time units, magnitudes
    
- **Why this matters:**
  : Every chart, comparison, and recommendation later assumes these rates are correct and consistent.


**Context:**
- [ ] Preset filtering edge cases
  - No preset selected
  - Preset selected but no matching runs
- [ ] Tier + Preset + Date range combinations
- [ ] Rolling windows (last N runs, last N days)
- [ ] Add:
  - One “context matrix” golden test
    - Same metric, same data
    - Different context inputs
    - Assert expected shape, not just values


**Effective Value**
- [ ] Effective Value vs Base Value
  
  For each parameter, show:
  
  - Base value (raw level value)
  - Effective value (after cards, labs, relics, etc.)

  This reinforces the mental model you’ve been building everywhere else:
  GameData → Derived Metrics → What actually happens in a run.

  just a tooltip or expandable row that says “+X% from Cards” is enough.
  
**Documentation**

- [ ]  Add Github Action to publish Docs to Github Pages
*** Phase 7 Power Tools

**** TODO [#A] Add Chart Builder Modal to Charts Dashboard
Let user select chart style and metrics to show. The Chart Builder is not a UI feature — it’s a schema and contract feature.

Before UI polish:
- A ChartConfig DTO
  - metric key(s)
  - chart type
  - grouping (time, tier, preset)
  - smoothing / aggregation options

Validation rules:
- Which metrics are compatible
- Which comparisons make sense
- A small, explicit allowed surface
- No arbitrary math
- No free-form queries
  *** TODO [#A] Comparison / Scenario View and Snapshots

Examples:
- Run A vs Run B
- Before vs after unlocking card slot
- With Guardian Chip/UW X vs without

This is where the app becomes decision-making, not logging.

Named snapshots:
- “Before unlocking UW X”
- “Post Guardian Fetch upgrade”

These become reusable comparison anchors in charts

**** TODO [#B] Data Quality & Confidence Signals

Players will ask:
- “Is this run weird?”
- “Did something change here?”

Add:
- Run flags (outlier, partial, anomalous)
- Visual markers on charts
- Simple heuristics, not ML

This builds trust without over-engineering.

**** TODO [#B] Performance Guardrails

As data grows:
- Cached derived results per view
- Explicit limits on chart density
- Warnings when comparisons get statistically thin

Do this before you have 30 guild members loading it daily.
**** TODO [#B] UW Sync Graph
There is synergy to using some UW together, specifically Golden Tower, Blackhole and Death Wave. It's common in the meta to keep the cooldowns and durations in sync. We should have the data to chart the three together and how often they overlap/synchronize

**** TODO [#C] Add Advice for Optimization
Based on logged performance data, it could be possible to calculate and offer suggestions based on the data.

For Example:
- Which UW to unlock next
- Bot properties to improve
- Guardian Chip properties to improve
- Weighted Preset Rankings
*** Phase 8 Multiple Player Support
**** TODO [#A] Wireup Github Actions to Run Tests
Run checks or Ruff Check, mypy ., pytest -q
**** TODO [#A] Allow Multiple Players to Store Data
***** Core Principle: Everything Belongs to a Player
**Analysis Engine is always player-scoped, even if there’s only one player.**
Every player-specific model must be bound to a Player.

Recommended structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Player(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    display_name = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
#+END_SRC

Then every mutable/progress model gets:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
player = models.ForeignKey(Player, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
#+END_SRC

This includes:
- player_cards
- player_relics
- player_labs
- battle_report
- run_history
- sim_results
- etc.

***** Authorization

Use groups + permissions, not custom flags.

Suggested groups
|Group |Purpose |
|---+---|
|admin | me |
|player| Default |

You can enforce almost everything via queryset filtering, not permissions alone.

***** Queryset Filtering Is the Real Security Layer

Permissions stop access.
Querysets prevent data leaks.

Pattern you’ll use everywhere

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def get_queryset(self):
    user = self.request.user
    if user.is_superuser:
        return Model.objects.all()
    return Model.objects.filter(player__user=user)
#+END_SRC

This applies to:
- Admin
- API views
- List views
- Export endpoints
- Sim endpoints

If you forget this once, players see each other’s data.

***** Django Admin: Lock It Down Properly
ModelAdmin example
#+BEGIN_SRC python
class PlayerCardAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_queryset(self, request):
        qs = super().get_queryset(request)
        if request.user.is_superuser:
            return qs
        return qs.filter(player__user=request.user)

    def save_model(self, request, obj, form, change):
        if not change:
            obj.player = request.user.player
        super().save_model(request, obj, form, change)
#+END_SRC

Also:

Remove player from editable fields for non-admins

Use readonly_fields where possible

***** API Layer (Even If You Don’t Build One Yet)

Design as if you will.

Never accept player_id from the client

Always derive it from request.user.

❌ Bad

{ "player_id": 12, "wave": 4500 }


✅ Good

player = request.user.player


This avoids spoofing and simplifies logic everywhere.

***** Shared vs Player-Scoped Models (Important Distinction)

You’ll have three categories of models:

A. Global Reference Data (NO player FK)

Cards

Relics

Labs

Enemies

Waves

Balance constants

These are read-only.

B. Player State (HAS player FK)

PlayerCard

PlayerRelic

PlayerLabProgress

Unlocks

Inventory

C. Derived / Cached Results (HAS player FK)

BattleReport

SimulationRun

AggregatedStats

You can safely delete category C anytime.

***** Data Migration & Onboarding Flow

You’ll need a clean onboarding path:

User creates account

Auto-create Player via signal

Assign default group player

Initialize baseline progress rows

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_player(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        Player.objects.create(user=instance)
**** TODO [#C] Export / Share (Lightweight)

- CSV export of derived metrics
- PNG export of charts

This dramatically increases perceived value with very little backend work.
** Backlog [0/3]
“Out of Scope”:
- Cloud sync
- Real-time scraping
  
*** TODO [#A] Efficiency Metrics
Examples:
- Stones per % improvement
- Stones per second saved
- Relative efficiency compared to other UWs

This is powerful, but it opens balance and interpretation questions. Best added once the core dashboards are stable.
*** TODO [#B] What to do with Units Class

We planned it out but have yet to implement it

*** TODO [#C] Required Doc Type Header (Must Prepend to All Docs)
Every document authored or modified by Codex must begin with exactly one of the following headers, placed at the very top of the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
User Guide Document
<!--
DOC TYPE: User Guide
AUDIENCE: Players / Non-technical users
PURPOSE: Explain how to use the feature, not how it is built
TONE: Professional, concise, non-technical
-->

Developer / Progress Document
<!--
DOC TYPE: Developer Documentation
AUDIENCE: Contributors / Maintainers
PURPOSE: Explain internal behavior, architecture, or project status
TONE: Technical, precise, implementation-aware
-->
#+END_SRC

**Enforcement Rules**
- Exactly one Doc Type Header is allowed per document
- The header must appear before any headings or content
- The selected doc type determines:
  - Tone
  - Structure
  - Allowed level of technical detail
- If the document content conflicts with the declared Doc Type, the document is considered invalid and must be rewritten

**Default Behavior**

If Codex is unsure which header to use:

- Default to User Guide
- Exclude internal details
- Favor task-based explanations
**** Checklist
