markers =
    unit: Speed marker. Pure, deterministic tests with no database access (unit ≠ fast by accident; keep it pure).
    integration: Speed marker. Tests that touch Django, the database, views, commands, or IO.
    regression: Semantic marker. Guards against a previously observed bug/regression.
    golden: Semantic marker. Snapshot/fixture-driven tests intended to be stable and explicit.
